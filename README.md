[CodeCollab][1] is a collaborative code editor similar to how Google Docs is a collaborative text editor. Users can create accounts, create projects, preview projects, share projects, and even extract text from images of code.

This project was created for Programming on the Web (CSCC09) at U of T and earned top marks.
